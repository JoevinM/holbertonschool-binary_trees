/**
 * binary_tree_preorder - Traverses a binary tree using pre-order traversal.
 * @tree: Pointer to the root node of the tree to traverse.
 * @func: Pointer to a function to call for each node visited.
 *
 * Description:
 * This function visits each node of a binary tree using pre-order traversal,
 * which processes nodes in the following order:
 *   1. Visit the current node
 *   2. Traverse the left subtree
 *   3. Traverse the right subtree
 *
 * At each node, the given function @func is called with the nodeâ€™s value.
 * If either @tree or @func is NULL, the function does nothing.
